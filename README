foo-dcpu16 is a DCPU16 compiler and emulator. DCPU16 is the specification for 
the computer systems emulated in the multiplayer game "0x10c" 
(http://0x10c.com/).

foo-dcpu16 can compile assembler code and save it to a file. It conforms to 
0xSCA standards (https://github.com/0x10cStandardsCommittee/0x10c-Standards).

It has a black and white console emulator with some keyboard input. The 
console emulator can load code from assembly code or a compiled file.

It also has a test harness which will allow targeted manipulation of the 
chip and data.

The compiler does some optimization for space and speed.
